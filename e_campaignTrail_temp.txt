Since the turn of the century, the elder La Follette and his sons have dominated the politics of the Badger State. Their campaigns, achievements, and battles have become mythos to the progressive movement. But times are changing. With the family patriarch dead 20 years, and the youngest out of electoral politics, Robert La Follette Jr. remains the last of the dynasty, having held his father’s senate seat since his death in 1925. But Robert is no ‘Fighting Bob’. He lacks the combative spirit and love for the campaign circuit his father and brother possessed. Forced into the role of a political leader, he now reluctantly takes charge of a progressive machine that has lost its way. Even still, the La Follette name is worth its weight in gold, and if he plays his cards correctly, his re-election is all but assured.","image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/thJmDJl.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":0,"advisor_url":"https://images.wisconsinhistory.org/700005070052/0507001321-l.jpg","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":0,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];

In fact, these days you’ll rarely see him around Wisconsin altogether. Since he begrudgingly went along with Phil in founding the Wisconsin Progressive Party, he has been averse to all types of political leadership or organizing, instead insulating himself within Washington. The truth is, Bob despises public life. He abhors the lack of privacy and constant need to please interest groups and fight back against the mudslinging prevalent in the political sphere. He’s bitter about being abandoned by Phil during the pre-war and war years, left to lead a party that he himself doesn’t want to exist. Although he has, after much deliberation, decided to stand for re-election, he has only done so on the promise that he will not have to fight for his seat.
