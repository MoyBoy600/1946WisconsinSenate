Since the turn of the century, the elder La Follette and his sons have dominated the politics of the Badger State. Their campaigns, achievements, and battles have become mythos to the progressive movement. But times are changing. With the family patriarch dead 20 years, and the youngest out of electoral politics, Robert La Follette Jr. remains the last of the dynasty, having held his father’s senate seat since his death in 1925. But Robert is no ‘Fighting Bob’. He lacks the combative spirit and love for the campaign circuit his father and brother possessed. Forced into the role of a political leader, he now reluctantly takes charge of a progressive machine that has lost its way. Even still, the La Follette name is worth its weight in gold, and if he plays his cards correctly, his re-election is all but assured.","image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/thJmDJl.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":0,"advisor_url":"https://i.imgur.com/ZcGIL4g.png","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":0,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];

From boyhood, “Young Bob” has known the ins and outs of Capitol Hill. When titans of the Progressive Era came over to Maple Bluff or Washington, Bob would listen closely. Many of his formative days were spent watching his father, Fighting Bob, perform his magic in the halls of congress or to the ravenous crowds along the prairie. From that age, it became clear to the elder Robert that his namesake was to be his political heir. And so the Senator would guide his son through school, college, and eventually to his congressional office in Washington, grooming him for a career that he did not want. But after father’s death, Bob would be compelled into succeeding his dad in the Senate, the only one with the magic name that could unite even the bitterest of progressive enemies. From there began a distinguished twenty-year career in the Senate highlighted by work instrumental in creating The New Deal, a revered investigative committee, assisting in forging a third party in Wisconsin that would briefly upend the two-party system, and working against American intervention abroad.

Ever reserved and antisocial, you’ll never find him among the parties of socialites in DC. Nor will you see him stumping on the campaign trail, always wary of retail politics. In fact, these days you’ll rarely see him around Wisconsin altogether. Since he begrudgingly went along with Phil in founding the Wisconsin Progressive Party, he has been averse to all types of political leadership or organizing, instead insulating himself within Washington. The truth is, Bob despises public life. He abhors the lack of privacy and constant need to please interest groups and fight back against the mudslinging prevalent in the political sphere. He’s bitter about being abandoned by Phil during the pre-war and war years, left to lead a party that he himself doesn’t want to exist. Although he has, after much deliberation, decided to stand for re-election, he has only done so on the promise that he will not have to fight for his seat. As spring brings the start of election season, all eyes turn to Bob, as his level of leadership will in all likelihood determine the outcome of the election.<br><br><button onclick='back3()'>Back</button></p>"

    text = "<p>Few men have had their lives so intrinsically tied to politics as Robert La Follette Jr has. From boyhood, “Young Bob” has known the ins and outs of Capitol Hill. When titans of the Progressive Era came over to Maple Bluff or Washington, Bob would listen closely. Many of his formative days were spent watching his father, Fighting Bob, perform his magic in the halls of congress or to the ravenous crowds along the prairie. From that age, it became clear to the elder Robert that his namesake was to be his political heir. And so the Senator would guide his son through school, college, and eventually to his congressional office in Washington, grooming him for a career that he did not want. But after father’s death, Bob would be compelled into succeeding his dad in the Senate, the only one with the magic name that could unite even the bitterest of progressive enemies. From there began a distinguished twenty-year career in the Senate highlighted by work instrumental in creating The New Deal, a revered investigative committee, assisting in forging a third party in Wisconsin that would briefly upend the two-party system, and working against American intervention abroad. Today, Bob is a nationally recognizable figure, with an illustrious reputation and popularity at home.<br><br><button onclick='next3()'>Next</button></p>"
