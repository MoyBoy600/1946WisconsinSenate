Now, I’m just about the last person you’d see criticizing La Follette’s term as governor. After the disastrous Doyle years, La Follette’s common sense, forward-thinking agenda has been nothing but a blessing for our ailing state. But as rightful concern is placed on President Biden’s age and capacity to lead, the last thing Republicans want to do is to appear the same as Democrats, and at 82, Doug is getting up there as one of the oldest governors in the state’s history. Now, although Doug is healthy, allowing one of our most well-known figures in the country to serve until he’s 86 would only go to show that we Republicans cannot actually talk the talk when it comes to electing young and able leaders. Besides, with 2022 looking to be slaughter for the Democrats, its high time we let young and bold leaders like Mandela Barnes and Tom Nelson get a crack at the Governor’s mansion.</p><p>Rest Doug, you’ve done more than enough.</p>";
